After an upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04, my ssh tunnels started to hang after some period of inactivity. Now if a ssh tunnel hangs, all one has to do is close the terminal. So inconvenient but managable. But if a sshfs tunnel hangs, then a simple ls command can hang the terminal. Or if you are using Nautilus (file manager), simply trying to browse to the mounted folder will cause a hang making you force quit the application. Lastly, desperation kicks in and you now try to force a umount, but OS will complain saying some resource is busy. To summarize, I am forced to restart every time a sshfs tunnel hangs which is really annoying.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Now vs Siri</title><link href="https://nahsin.github.io/musings/2015/12/13/siri-vs-googlenow.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Now vs Siri" /><published>2015-12-13T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2015-12-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://nahsin.github.io/musings/2015/12/13/siri-vs-googlenow</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">So when it comes to artificial intelligence, who is smarter, Appleâ€™s Siri or Google Now? There are two components to this question; voice/language recognition and data mining. As one might expect, Google is the clear winner in the data mining category. But as the following list of questions shows, Google Now also possess vastly superior voice recognition traits. On the other hand, Siri could not even understand most of these questions by voice, and even if it did or I typed them, the result was a simple Bing search. So try them out yourself.</summary></entry></feed>
